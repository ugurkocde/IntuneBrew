      "description": "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7.23 and below, a logic bug allows a malicious agent to read sensitive files that should be protected via cursorignore. An attacker who has already achieved prompt injection, or a malicious model, could create a new cursorignore file which can invalidate the configuration of pre-existing ones. This could allow a malicious agent to read protected files. This issue is fixed in version 2.0.",

      "description": "Cursor is a code editor built for programming with AI. In versions 1.7.28 and below, an input validation flaw in Cursor's MCP server installation enables specially crafted deep-links to bypass the standard security warnings and conceal executed commands from users if they choose to accept the server. If an attacker is able to convince a victim to navigate to a malicious deeplink, the victim will not see the correct speedbump modal, and if they choose to accept, will execute commands specified by the attackers deeplink.",
