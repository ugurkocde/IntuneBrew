An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.\n\nThe specific flaw exists within the handling of background images. By creating a junction, an attacker can abuse the service to read arbitrary files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to disclose stored credentials, leading to further compromise.
